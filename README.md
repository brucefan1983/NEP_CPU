# NEP_CPU

# What does this repository contain?

* A **standalone** C++ implementation (a class called `NEP3`) of the neuroevolution potential (NEP) as introduced in the GPUMD package (https://github.com/brucefan1983/GPUMD). We stress that **there is no external dependence**. Even though the class name is `NEP3`, the implementation works for all versions of NEP.

* An interface of the `NEP3` class to the CPU version of LAMMPS (https://github.com/lammps/lammps). **It can be run with MPI**.

# The standalone C++ implementation of NEP

* The `NEP3` C++ class is defined in the following three files:
  * `src/nep.h`
  * `src/nep.cpp`
  * `src/dftd3para.h`
  
* There is an option to use tables to speed up the calculations for the radial functions in NEP. To enable it, one can change line 20 of `src/nep.h`:

```
// #define USE_TABLE_FOR_RADIAL_FUNCTIONS
```

* The following folders contain some testing code and results:
  * `test/`
  * `test_dftd3/`
  
* The `NEP3` C++ class is used as an engine powering the following Python packages:
  * `calorine`: https://gitlab.com/materials-modeling/calorine
  * `PyNEP`: https://github.com/bigd4/PyNEP
  * `somd`: https://github.com/initqp/somd
  
# The NEP-LAMMPS interface

## Build the NEP-LAMMPS interface

* step 1: Copy the files in `src/` into `interface/lammps/USER-NEP/` such that you have the following files in `interface/lammps/USER-NEP/`:
  * `nep.h`
  * `nep.cpp`
  * `dftd3para.h`
  * `pair_NEP.h`
  * `pair_NEP.cpp`
  * `install.sh`
  
* Step 2: Now you can copy the `USER-NEP/` folder into `YOUR_LAMMPS_PATH/src/` and start to compile LAMMPS in your favorite way. Good luck!
  
## Use the NEP-LAMMPS interface

* `units` must be `metal`
  
* Specify the `pair_style` in the following way:
  
  ```shell
  A.for pure nep potential
  pair_style nep 
  pair_coeff * * YOUR_NEP_MODEL_FILE.txt Pd Cu Ni P  # YOUR_NEP_MODEL_FILE.txt is your NEP model file (with path)
  
  B.for hybrid potential ï¼ˆe.g. NEP +  LJ/CUT)
  pair_style 	hybrid  nep 	 lj/cut 12.0   
  pair_coeff  * *     nep nep.txt  Pd Cu Ni P  NULL NULL NULL NULL   NULL # NULL means the type that is not described by NEP
  ```
  
  The **./example** directory contains detailed usage examples.
  
* For multi-element system, the atom types must be carefully set. Take a NEP model `NEP_PdCuNiP.txt` as an example. In this NEP model file, the first line is `nep3 4 Pd Cu Ni P`. Then in your LAMMPS input file, you must set 

  * Pd atoms to type 1
  * Cu atoms to type 2
  * Ni atoms to type 3
  * P atoms to type 4

* Some atom types can be missing in the simulated system. For example you can use the above NEP model to simulate a CuNi binary alloy. It is important to make sure to still set Cu atoms to type 2 and Ni atoms to type 3. In this case, atom types 1 and 4 are missing.

* One can hybrid NEP with other potentials in LAMMPS.

* If you want to calculate the heat current correctly, use the following command to get the 9-component per-atom virial:
  ```shell
  compute 1 all centroid/stress/atom NULL
  ```
